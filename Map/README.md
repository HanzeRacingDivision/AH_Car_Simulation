python requirements:
- numba (used to make generalFunctions faster. There is also a noNumba version though)
- (only for map file loading) pandas (version doesnt matter, but it must be the same on both if using remote visualization)
- (only for real-life model car control) pyserial (only in carMCUclass.py)
